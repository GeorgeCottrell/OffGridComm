# OffGridComm

**OffGridComm** is a decentralized, low-bandwidth communications platform built for ham radio frequencies. Inspired by classic BBS systems and modern mesh networks, it is designed for asynchronous, legally compliant communication in offline and grid-down environments.

---

## üéØ Purpose

OffGridComm enables licensed amateur radio operators to:

* Send and receive direct or group messages
* Participate in Usenet-style interest-based discussion boards
* Relay messages node-to-node using amateur radio frequencies (no internet required)
* Operate with a clean, ANSI-art capable text-based interface (TUI)
* Ensure message authenticity through callsign-based identity
* Support mouse and keyboard navigation via modern terminal emulators (e.g. PuTTY, SyncTERM)

---

## üîê Legal Compliance

OffGridComm is designed in full alignment with **FCC Part 97** regulations:

* No encryption is used
* All messages are tied to valid amateur radio callsigns
* All content is non-commercial
* Supports only licensed operators as authenticated users

---

## üöß MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Goals:

* [ ] TUI interface with ANSI display and mouse/keyboard navigation
* [ ] Callsign-based login and identity system
* [ ] Message composition, viewing, and local storage
* [ ] Group message board system (like Usenet)
* [ ] RF packet exchange between nodes (via AX.25 or other modes)
* [ ] Local deduplication and message propagation system
* [ ] Static offline callsign database verification

### üîú Phase 2 Goals:

* [ ] Internet-connected nodes can fetch up-to-date callsign databases
* [ ] Online nodes compress and sign these updates
* [ ] Offline nodes receive updates via RF from trusted peers
* [ ] Support international callsign data via modular country-specific importers
* [ ] RF-safe distribution of additional resources (weather, bulletins, software updates)

## üß± Architecture Overview

Each **OffGridComm Node** includes:

* TUI frontend with ANSI support (`ratatui`)
* Message system (direct, group)
* Identity/auth engine (callsign + password)
* RF interface layer (Direwolf, soundmodem, etc.)
* Node sync protocol (custom, store-and-forward)
* Optional internet module to fetch and rebroadcast trusted data updates

> Future versions will support automated scheduling, message compression, and regional relays.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

* Rust ü¶† (core logic + TUI)
* `ratatui`, `crossterm`, and `tui-input` (terminal UI)
* `serde`, `serde_json`, `ron`, and `toml` (serialization and config)
* `sqlx` and `rusqlite` (SQLite database support)
* `tokio`, `axum`, `tower`, `hyper`, and `tokio-tungstenite` (async runtime and web stack)
* `argon2`, `blake3`, `uuid`, and `rand` (crypto and identity)
* `flate2`, `lz4_flex`, and `zstd` (compression)
* `reqwest` and `dotenvy` (HTTP and environment handling)
* `serialport` and `ax25` (RF transport, serial interface)
* `tracing`, `anyhow`, and `thiserror` (logging and error handling)

---

## üîÑ Callsign Verification Strategy

OffGridComm uses a hybrid approach:

* A static snapshot of a public callsign database (FCC or other)
* Optional self-attestation or license submission during setup
* Optional download of updated databases by internet-connected nodes
* Propagation of updates over RF using signed and timestamped update packages

This ensures:

* Fully offline verification capability
* Legal operator compliance
* Prevents impersonation or rogue node behavior

International support is provided via modular importers for country-specific licensing databases.

---

## üîè Password Handling and FCC Compliance

OffGridComm does not transmit or share passwords over RF. All passwords are:

* Used only for **local login authentication**
* Stored securely on-device using modern password hashing (e.g., Argon2)
* Never transmitted, encrypted or otherwise, in compliance with FCC Part 97

Operator identity over the network is established via:

* Publicly visible callsigns
* Optional node-origin signatures (plaintext verifiable)

This design ensures both user accountability and regulatory compliance without compromising privacy or system integrity.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Notice

You must be a **licensed amateur radio operator** to use OffGridComm over RF bands. Unauthorized or encrypted use over amateur frequencies is **prohibited** and may violate local or national laws.

## üì± Stay Tuned

OffGridComm is in active development. Future versions will support:

* Automated propagation scheduling
* RF beaconing and mesh discovery
* Custom protocol modes for extreme QRP conditions
* Print/PDF field deployment guides

Join the wave of resilient, decentralized communication.
